These fabrications you put forth on me
They lacerate this soul
I try to run
You sunder me open to see my blood shed
To hear not my pain
Merely your own
You sire these avulsions
And I pray for you
To sew these afflictions
With your propaganda
I've seen no veracity
Beneath that breast
Why do I adhere to your idiocy
I'm only belaboring you
Right now
You're nothing
In my eyes
I can now
Taste deception
In your heart
You're nothing
See my blood shed
