Anguish
Can't take it no more
Agony
Always knocking at my door
Close my eyes and try to escape
Only to wake up in hell
Everyday
No one told me life would be this way
No one told me about the
Anguish
Can't take it no more
Agony
Always knocking at my door
Anger trapped
Red is all I see
But I know it'll get the best of me
"Seek some help"
Yeah I've tried before
But I know what I am
And that's hate at my core
So leave me with my
Anguish
Agony
Anger
Hate
