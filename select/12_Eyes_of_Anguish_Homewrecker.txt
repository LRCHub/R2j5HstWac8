He decieved god of his power
Controlled life and death
Left himself helpless
(Helpless)
A broken man from a broken family

Phony
You chose to live inside your mind
You're finished
You tried fightning the nothingness inside
No matter the pain (pain)
It isn't worth the time or shame
Left his hurt upon one man
Who can't find his way

I can't find the reasons

I can't find the answers to calm this man's soul
One look into his face and you'll see hell yourself

In a moment's time you made up your mind
Simple
Selfish
Thinking of yourself
You were only thinking of yourself

I can't forget when you were so proud
The silent screams were so fucking loud

I will never understand the choices you have made
I won't turn my back
I won't lose my friends
Your mistakes have caused this bitter fucking end
